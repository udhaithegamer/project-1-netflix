# project-1-netflix
Hey guys,

This project showcases a Netflix homepage created 
using HTML and CSS. It's part of my third task as
an intern at Bharat. The homepage mimics the popular
streaming platform, providing a visually appealing user
interface. You can explore this project to learn about 
web development, design, and layout techniques. 
Feel free to check out the code on GitHub and see 
how it was built step by step. Happy coding!
